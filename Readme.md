# HFM_Mathematica_Notebooks

This repository contains a series of notebooks illustrating the HFM (Hamilton Fast Marching) C++ library. 
They were created by Jorg Portegies, and are intended as a companion for the IPOL submission :
Jean - Marie Mirebeau, Jorg Portegies, "A fast marching solver with adaptive stencils", 2018 (submitted) 

Summary:
* Isotropic metrics and base functionality
* Riemannian metrics and geodesics
* Global optimization of curvature dependent energies
* The Reeds-Shepp model on R3 x S2

The HamiltonFastMarching (HFM) library, also has interfaces to the MatlabÂ® and Python languages, and comes with a series of additional examples, including in the Mathematica Language.
